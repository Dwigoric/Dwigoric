### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹<!-- General Kenobi -->

The alias Dwigoric is my online identity. I am currently taking BS Computer Science with Specialization in Software Technology. In the future, I want to be a web developer and work on networking and informatics. I do not yet have large projects, but I am a large contributor in a game called [Germ Fighter](https://github.com/insane-devs/germ-fighter). I am also the main developer of the [Discord](https://discord.com) bot [Stalwartle](https://bit.ly/invite-stalwartle).


I also accept Discord bot commissions. You can reach out to me by joining Stalwartle's Discord [Support Server](https://discord.gg/KDWGvV8).
